[2025-07-21T18:24:38.117714] Logical Error: The approach incorrectly assumes all competitor posts are high-performing, which skews the semantic centroid by including potentially low-quality content and invalidates it as a true benchmark of excellence.
[2025-07-21T18:45:10.953951] Logical Error: Incorrectly used DataFrame index labels from the groupby operation to slice the embeddings tensor, which requires integer positional indices, creating a data mismatch during centroid calculation.
[2025-07-21T18:51:21.275493] The code failed to run because it was not self-contained, omitting the necessary `import sys` statement required by the execution environment, which resulted in a `NameError`.
[2025-07-21T18:55:00.193622] Logical Error: The responsibility of importing the `sys` module was incorrectly placed in the feature script, which doesn't use it, instead of the calling execution script where it was actually needed.
[2025-07-21T19:02:39.815755] Logical Error: By dropping the original DataFrame's index before processing, the code creates a critical risk of silently misaligning the calculated features with the incorrect rows upon assignment.
[2025-07-21T19:05:46.349905] The developer incorrectly assumed that importing the `sys` module within their own script would resolve a `NameError` for `sys` in the separate, external script responsible for execution.
[2025-07-21T19:09:42.504680] Logical Error: The code was incorrectly structured as a standalone command-line application with its own `__main__` block, which is incompatible with an execution environment that calls the logic directly without guaranteeing the script's top-level imports are in scope.
[2025-07-21T19:28:24.477821] Logical Error: The generated feature was assigned to the column 'semantic_distance_to_centroid', which does not match the required output column name 'semantic_distance_from_ideal'.
[2025-07-21T19:36:53.748959] Logical Error: The entire analytical strategy is built upon grouping data by the 'representative_keyword' column, which does not exist in the input DataFrame.
