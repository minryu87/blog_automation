This thematic stability provides a better, more predictable user experience and signals high quality to search engines, as every part of the content reinforces the main topic. Therefore, a lower `title_adherence_consistency` score (representing less variance and higher consistency) is expected to have a negative correlation with poor performance, which translates to a positive correlation with `non_brand_inflow` and `non_brand_average_ctr`.\n--- FAILED CODE ---\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util\nimport nltk\nimport os\n\n# 1.

By measuring the cumulative semantic distance between consecutive sentences and normalizing it by the post's word count, we can compare the semantic richness of articles regardless of their length. A higher normalized journey length signifies a more in-depth and less repetitive article per word, which provides greater value to the user. Search engines reward such comprehensive content, leading to better rankings and, consequently, a greater `non_brand_inflow`.\n--- FAILED CODE ---\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util\nimport nltk\nimport torch\n\n# 1.

High variance in the semantic similarity scores between individual body sentences and the title suggests the article's focus is unstable, with some parts being on-topic and others drifting away. This inconsistency can harm user experience and signal a poor content structure to search engines. We hypothesize that a higher `semantic_topic_variance` score (more drift) will negatively correlate with `non_brand_inflow` and `non_brand_average_ctr`.\n--- FAILED CODE ---\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util\nimport nltk\nimport os\n\n# Set a specific NLTK data path to avoid user-wide installation issues\nnltk_data_path = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser(\"~\"), \"nltk_data\")\nif not os.path.exists(nltk_data_path):\n    os.makedirs(nltk_data_path)\nnltk.data.path.append(nltk_data_path)\n\n# 1.

The introduction sets the stage, and the body should deliver on that promise. We can measure this by calculating the semantic similarity between the embedding of the introductory sentences (e.g., the first 3) and the embedding of the remainder of the article's body. A high similarity score indicates a coherent article that follows through on its initial premise. This coherence leads to better user engagement (lower bounce rates, longer dwell time) and signals high quality to search engines, thus positively impacting `non_brand_inflow` and `non_brand_average_ctr`.\n--- FAILED CODE ---\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util\nimport nltk\nimport re\n\n# 1.

A cross-encoder, specifically trained on relevance ranking tasks, will provide a more accurate measure of how relevant each sentence in the `post_body` is to the `post_title` (viewed as a query). A higher average relevance score from a cross-encoder indicates a better and more consistent 'answer' to the user's implicit query throughout the text. This should strongly correlate with a higher `non_brand_average_ctr` (as it directly meets user expectation from the SERP) and `non_brand_inflow` (as search engines reward this superior fulfillment of search intent).\n--- FAILED CODE ---\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder\nimport nltk\nimport logging\nimport os\n\n# Configure logging to be less verbose for library outputs\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARNING)\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n_model = None\n_nltk_punkt_downloaded = False\n\ndef _ensure_nltk_punkt():\n    \"\"\"Lazy-downloads the NLTK 'punkt' tokenizer if not already present.\"\"\"\n    global _nltk_punkt_downloaded\n    if not _nltk_punkt_downloaded:\n        try:\n            # Check if 'punkt' is already available in common NLTK data paths\n            nltk.data.find('tokenizers/punkt')\n        except nltk.downloader.NLTKDownloadError:\n            logger.warning(\"NLTK 'punkt' tokenizer not found.

A higher average relevance score from a cross-encoder indicates a better and more consistent 'answer' to the user's implicit query throughout the text.

By first identifying semantic clusters (sub-topics) within the `post_body` and then using a powerful cross-encoder to score the relevance of each cluster's theme to the title, we can find the `peak_subtopic_relevance`. A higher score signifies the presence of a strong, central \"answer chunk,\" which is a powerful signal of quality and user intent fulfillment. This should lead to higher user satisfaction, better engagement signals (`non_brand_average_ctr`), and consequently, improved search rankings (`non_brand_inflow`).\n--- FAILED CODE ---\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util\nfrom sentence_transformers.cross_encoder import CrossEncoder\nimport nltk\n\n# 1.

This revised approach measures the same concept\u2014content focus\u2014by breaking the post body into fixed-size, overlapping word chunks (e.g., 50 words). We then calculate the semantic similarity of each chunk to the post title using an efficient bi-encoder. The standard deviation of these similarity scores (`chunk_relevance_volatility`) represents the thematic consistency. A high volatility suggests the topic drifts, creating a poor user experience. We hypothesize a *negative* correlation between this feature and SEO metrics (`non_brand_inflow`, `non_brand_average_ctr`). This method avoids the fragile `nltk` dependency and is robust for the given data format.",

More critically, the dataset specification states the `post_body` is a continuous string without reliable sentence separators, making that approach flawed. This new hypothesis proposes measuring content breadth without sentence splitting. A high-quality, comprehensive article covers various facets of a topic. This semantic breadth can be measured by splitting the article into fixed-size text chunks and calculating the average semantic distance between them. A higher average distance (i.e., lower average similarity) indicates greater diversity and a more thorough exploration of the subject, which should correlate positively with `non_brand_inflow` as search engines reward comprehensive content.",
